* RedditV - Subreddit Video Player
  *This is still a work in progress. There is currently no toggle for
  NSFW, so use extreme caution if you are at a workplace!*

  You can still check out the beta at http://benzap.github.io/redditv

** Keyboard Controls

   You can use the *Left Arrow Key* and *Right Arrow Keys* to navigate
   to the previous and next videos

** Routes
   You can provide videos from a different subreddit by including it
   within the url like so --> http://benzap.github.io/redditv/#/r/AwfulCommercials

** Known Bugs

   Some things involving the search bar can be quite buggy. Still
   working them out.

** Supported Videos

   Currently, it only supports youtube videos. I hope to expand on
   that in the future.
